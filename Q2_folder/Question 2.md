# Neural Network Approach: Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

For the neural network approach, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) can be employed. SOMs are unsupervised learning algorithms designed for clustering and visualization tasks. Unlike K-Means, which assumes spherical clusters, SOMs can detect non-linear relationships between data points, making them more suitable for complex customer behaviour patterns.

SOMs work by projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional 2D map, where similar customers are placed close together. This visualization of customer segments allows for an intuitive understanding of customer relationships, which is not possible with traditional clustering algorithms like K-Means. For this dataset, preprocessing steps 
include handling missing data, normalizing features, and selecting relevant features such as BALANCE, PURCHASES, PAYMENTS, and CREDIT_LIMIT. After preprocessing, the SOM grid is defined (e.g., 10x10 or 15x15), and the model is trained by adjusting weights to minimize the distance between input vectors and their closest nodes.

Once the SOM is trained, clusters can be identified using a clustering algorithm like K-Means on the SOM node weights. The proximity between nodes on the SOM map indicates the similarity between customer segments. Although SOMs offer more flexibility than K-Means and are better suited for identifying non-linear clusters, they are also more complex 
to implement and interpret. The resulting 2D map requires more effort to analyse compared to the centroids produced by K-Means.

When comparing K-Means with SOM, the former is more scalable and easier to interpret, whereas SOM excels in handling non-linear relationships and offers a visualization that makes cluster relationships easier to grasp. K-Means works best with spherical clusters, while SOM can handle more complex, irregular shapes. 
While SOM is more robust to outliers and noise, K-Means is often quicker and simpler to apply, making it more suitable for straightforward segmentation tasks.
